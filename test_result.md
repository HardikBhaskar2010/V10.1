        comment: "❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: AI generation fails to display ideas despite successful API calls. OpenRouter API returns 200 status, components are properly loaded, Generate button works, but NO ideas appear in UI. Issue is in response parsing or React state management, not localStorage or API connectivity."
